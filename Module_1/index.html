      Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to
      start - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy,
      overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress,
      those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet.
      On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza
      was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost 100
      pounds and completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on
      different planets. The thing is that once I escaped.
